This repository uses Julia to follow Dr. David Kopriva's book: *Implementing Spectral Methods for Partial Differential Equations*

Jupyter notebooks (via Jupyater Lab) are provided for each along with a library that one can use as one goes deeper into the lessons. 

It is split up into Part I, Part IIa, PartIIb, PartIIc, and an extra Part III. All parts are done in 1D for learning purposes. 

**Part I:** This goes through Chapters 1-3 in the textbook. Sets up the Julia environment with all the packages necessary. The algorithms in these three chapters are developed in Julia

**Part II:** TBD soon

**Part III:** TBD soon
