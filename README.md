# **Implementing Spectral Methods for Partial Differential Equations in Julia**
----------------------------

written by Ernesto Barraza-Valdez with the help of Dr. David Kopriva

-----------------------------

This repository uses Julia to follow Dr. David Kopriva's book: *Implementing Spectral Methods for Partial Differential Equations*

Jupyter notebooks (via Jupyater Lab) are provided for each along with a library that one can use as one goes deeper into the lessons. 

It is split up into Part I, Part IIa, PartIIb, PartIIc, and an extra Part III. All parts are done in 1D for learning purposes. 

* **Part I:** This goes through Chapters 1-3 in the textbook. Sets up the Julia environment with all the packages necessary. The algorithms in these three chapters are developed in Julia

* **Part 2a:** Goes through Chapters 4 in the textbook, Survey of Spectral Approximations. The Fourier, Chebyshev, and Legendre Collocation, Modal Galerkin, Nodal Continuous Galerkin, and Nodal Discontinuous Galerkin Method are reviewed.

* **Part 2b:** Goes through Chapters 5 in the textbook, Spectral Approximations on the Square. The Fourier, Chebyshev, and Legendre Collocation, Modal Galerkin, Nodal Continuous Galerkin, and Nodal Discontinuous Galerkin Method are reviewed in 2D. The wave equation is reviewed.

* **Part 2c:** Goes through Chapters 8 in the textbook, Spectral Elements Method. The Spectral Element Nodal Continuous Galerkin and Nodal Discontinuous Galerkin Methods are reviewed in 1D

* **Part III:** TBD soon
